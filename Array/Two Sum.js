 * Problem: Two Sum
 * Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
 * 
 * Output: Array of two integers `[index1, index2]`
 * 
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
