 * Problem: Daily Temperatures
 * Given an array of integers `temperatures` represents the daily temperatures, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the `i`th day to get a warmer temperature.
 * If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0` instead.
 *
 * Output: Array of integers

 * @param {number[]} temperatures
 * @return {number[]}
