/**
 * Problem: Linked List Cycle
 * Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer.
 * Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.
 * 
 * Output: Boolean (`true` if cycle exists, `false` otherwise)
 * 
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 * 
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
