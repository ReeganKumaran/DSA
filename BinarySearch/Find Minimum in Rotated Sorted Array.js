/**
 * Problem: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
 * Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between `1` and `n` times.
 * Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
 *
 * Output: Integer (minimum element)
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
