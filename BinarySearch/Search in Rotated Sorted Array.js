/**
 * Problem: Search in Rotated Sorted Array
 * There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
 * Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index `k` (1 <= k < nums.length).
 * Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not in `nums`.
 * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 *
 * Output: Integer (index of target or -1)
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number}
